Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS)
This project is a Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) built using blockchain technology. It leverages a decentralized architecture to provide secure and tamper-proof identity management, ensuring privacy and security for the user data. The system uses React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Express.js and MongoDB for the backend, and Ethereum Blockchain with Solidity smart contracts, powered by Ganache, Ether.js, and Hardhat for blockchain interactions.
Features
Decentralized Identity Storage: User identities are stored securely on the blockchain, ensuring data privacy and preventing tampering.
Blockchain-based Authentication: Authentication is conducted through smart contracts, offering a more secure way to manage identities.
Smart Contract Interaction: The system uses Ether.js for interacting with smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
Scalable Backend: The backend uses Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB to handle user data that isn’t stored on the blockchain.
Responsive UI: Frontend built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a seamless user experience across devices.
Development Environment: Powered by Ganache for local blockchain simulation and Hardhat for compiling and deploying smart contracts.
Tech Stack
Frontend
React.js: For building the user interface.
Tailwind CSS: For styling and responsive design.
Backend
Node.js & Express.js: To manage API routes and business logic.
MongoDB: For storing user data and session details.
Blockchain
Ethereum: The platform used for deploying smart contracts.
Solidity: The language used to write smart contracts.
Ganache: Local Ethereum blockchain for development and testing.
Ether.js: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
Hardhat: For smart contract compilation, deployment, and testing.
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (>= 14.x.x)
MongoDB
Ganache (for local blockchain simulation)
MetaMask (for connecting to the blockchain)
Hardhat (for smart contract deployment and testing)
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dims-blockchain.git
cd dims-blockchain
Backend Setup
Install the backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Set up your environment variables. Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following:

bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
PORT=5000
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Frontend Setup
Install the frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Blockchain Setup
Install Hardhat:

bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev hardhat
Compile the smart contracts:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat compile
Deploy the contracts to Ganache:

Make sure Ganache is running locally.
Deploy the contract:
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
Connect your MetaMask wallet to the local Ganache blockchain and import an account using the private keys provided by Ganache.

Usage
Access the Frontend: Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to interact with the decentralized identity management system.
User Authentication: Users can create decentralized identities, and log in using blockchain-based authentication.
Smart Contract Interaction: The app will interact with the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask, securely managing user identities through deployed smart contracts.
